Install `PlantUML` extension in `VSCode` to preview diagrams.
It needs to have a java installed.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

There is a GitHub Action in place that creates a wiki page for all diagrams in `./sequence-diagrams` folder.
It generates links for PNGs from uml code using PlantUML server.
